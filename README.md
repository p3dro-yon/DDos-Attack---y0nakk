Best DDos Attack taking down servers via CMD (ATTENTION: this file was made for learning purposes only; I am not responsible for such a criminal act)

2. When opening, paste the IP of the server you want to take down (for this, run this command in your command prompt: 'ping [server adress]').
3. Press ENTER and that's it!
