# DDos-Attack/y0nakk
A DDos Attack taking down servers via CMD (ATTENTION: this file was made for learning purposes only; I am not responsible for such a criminal act)

# How to run the file
1. Extract the .zip file and open the .cmd file inside.
2. When opening, paste the IP of the server you want to take down (for this, run this command in your command prompt: ping [server adress]).
3. Press ENTER and that's it!

# Notes
* Don't try to take down big servers like Google, YouTube, stores and forums. This script was made to take down small servers, like blogs.
